OnixJS
================
A semi-opinionated framework designed to address goals like flexibility, stability, connectivity, and performance.

## Installation

````sh
$ npm install @onixjs/core
````

## Phylosophy
The OnixJS phylosophy is to empower developers to decide which dependencies they want to install and maintain in their projects.

We strongly believe that staging or deploying your project, now or in a year... MUST NOT be affected by the framework or any of its dependencies, and that is the reason of why we decided to use practically zero dependencies.

All of this while providing with cool and modern features and mechanisms to build a better communicated, more stable and scalable product.

## Features

- Built-in TypeScript
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA - Micro Services)
- Remote Procedure Call API (RPC)
- Universal SDK (For any framework: Angular, React, Vue, Even Native JS)
- Back-end compatible with any ORM (Mongoose, Sequalize, TypeORM, Etc)
